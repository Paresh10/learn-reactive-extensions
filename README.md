# Reactive Extensions Learning

## Getting Started

This exercise is best done with the docker setup. Start the app by using
`docker-compose up`. The first time will take a while as it installs
dependencies. 
After that you can re-run the application with `docker-compose up`.

The app will start on http://localhost:3000. Futher directions are found there.
