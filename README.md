# Reactive Extensions Learning

## Getting Started

This exercise is best done with the docker setup. Start the app by using
`docker-compose up`. The first time will take a while as it installs dependencies. 

After that you can re-run the application with `docker-compose up` and it should
be quite fast.

The app will start on http://localhost:3000. Futher directions are found there.

## Yarn

The exercises can be run directly using `yarn start` however be warned they were
developed on MacOS, so if you're using a Windows machine I cannot guarantee they work.
