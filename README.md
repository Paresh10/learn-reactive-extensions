## Getting Started

This exercise is best done using Gitpod. Simply click the `Gitpod` ready-to-code button at the top of the README,
and you'll open a new browser tab with the Gitpod editor and the server running. The first time it starts it will
install dependencies for you - you can see it running yarn install at the bottom of the screen - so it'll be a moment 
before you can start editing. You'll know it's ready when a preview browser window appears on the right hand side. You'll
probably want to click it's url to open it in a new browser tab, as it's pretty small. Finally browse to src/exercises/puzzles.ts
and you can start working on the exercises. All told it takes about 3 minutes to get up and running, not counting signing in with
Github.  See the screencast below:

Gitpod only requires a Github account, so setting up should be easy and you should be familiar with the editor 
if you've ever used Visual Studio Code. Futher directions are found on the home page of the first page of the Reactive Exercises.

## Yarn

The exercises can be run directly by cloning and using `yarn start` however be warned they were
developed on MacOS, so if you're using a Windows machine I cannot guarantee they work.
