# Reactive Extensions Learning

## Getting Started

This exercise is best done with the docker setup. The first time you run the app
you'll need to make sure you install the dependencies, so you can start it with
this command:

`docker-compose run server yarn install`

That will take a while as it installs dependencies. After that you can run the
application with `docker-compose up`.

The app will start on http://localhost:3000
