# Reactive Extensions Learning

## Getting Started

This exercise is best done using Gitpod. Simply click the `Gitpod` badge at the top of the README,
and you'll open a new browser tab with the Gitpod editor and the server running. Gitpod only
requires a Github account, so setting up should be easy and you should be familiar with it 
if you've ever used Visual Studio Code.

From there you'll want to open the Preview window in it's own tab by clicking the link. The
preview browser tab is just too small otherwise.

Futher directions are found on the home page of the first page of the Reactive Exercises.

## Yarn

The exercises can be run directly by cloning and using `yarn start` however be warned they were
developed on MacOS, so if you're using a Windows machine I cannot guarantee they work.
